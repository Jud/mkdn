# Quick Build: Showcase Readme

**Created**: 2026-02-06T00:00:00Z
**Request**: Create a beautiful README that showcases every feature of the mkdn app -- Mermaid rendering, native code highlighting, theming, chrome-less UI, keyboard-driven controls, and more.
**Scope**: Small

## Plan

**Reasoning**: Single file change (README.md), zero code systems affected, zero risk. Pure documentation work.
**Files Affected**: README.md
**Approach**: Rewrite README.md as a showcase document that demonstrates every mkdn feature using the Markdown elements the app itself renders. Include Mermaid diagrams (rendered natively by the app), fenced code blocks (syntax highlighted by Splash), tables, blockquotes, headings, links, lists, and thematic breaks. The README should double as both documentation and a live demo file you can open in mkdn itself.
**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour

## Tasks

- [x] **T1**: Write the full showcase README.md with all sections: hero, feature highlights with detailed descriptions, architecture diagram (Mermaid flowchart), rendering pipeline (Mermaid sequence diagram), keyboard shortcuts table, code samples, installation/build instructions, and design philosophy `[complexity:medium]`

## Implementation Summary

| Task | Files | Approach | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| T1 | `README.md` | Rewrote as showcase document with hero section, 10 detailed feature descriptions, 2 Mermaid diagrams (architecture flowchart + rendering sequence), keyboard shortcuts table, Swift code sample, install/build instructions, project structure, dependencies table, and design philosophy. The file doubles as a live demo when opened in mkdn itself. | Done |
