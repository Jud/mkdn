Pixel Analysis of Mermaid Container Area
==========================================
Image: CGWindowListCreateImage capture, 1776x1000 @ 2x (888x500 points)
Capture: 5 seconds after renderComplete, window is key/main

Top edge pixels (y=0 to y=5): Uniform #0e2a35 (composited base02)
Left edge pixels (x=0 to x=5): Uniform #0e2a35

Blue pixel search (entire image, b > r+50 AND b > g+50 AND b > 100):
  Total distinctly blue pixels: 0

Anomalous color search (first 20 rows, distance > 15 from both backgrounds):
  No anomalous colors found

CONCLUSION: The blue outline is NOT present in the programmatic capture.
This suggests the outline is either:
1. Environment-specific (user's macOS settings differ)
2. Interaction-dependent (requires click/tab/focus change to appear)
3. Drawn by the window server/compositor (not captured by CGWindowListCreateImage)
4. Related to keyboard navigation accessibility setting
