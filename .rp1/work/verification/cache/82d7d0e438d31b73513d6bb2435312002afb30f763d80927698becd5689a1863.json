Blockquotes traditionally use a vertical bar or border on the left edge to visually distinguish them from regular indented content.",
        "assessment": "The blockquote may benefit from a more prominent left-edge visual indicator (such as a colored vertical bar) to clearly distinguish it from other indented content. Without a visible border, the blockquote's visual identity relies solely on indentation, which could be confused with nested list content. However, the padding and indentation values themselves appear appropriate.",

While this is a test fixture, the comment rendering behavior suggests HTML comments in markdown may not be suppressed, which could affect real-world documents with HTML comments.
