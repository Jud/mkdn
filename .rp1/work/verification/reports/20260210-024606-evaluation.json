      "assessment": "The empty spaces where diagrams should appear create an awkward, incomplete layout that significantly detracts from the 'polished and intentional' composition standard.

The transition from the metadata comment block to the heading to the Keywords section flows naturally. Code blocks have rounded corners and consistent padding.",
