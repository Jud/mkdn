# Inline Code Animation

The `AnimationConstants.fadeIn` primitive uses a 0.5s ease-out curve.

Each block has a `staggerDelay` of 30ms between successive elements.

The `staggerCap` limits total entrance duration to 0.5 seconds.

Use `MotionPreference(reduceMotion:)` to resolve animation primitives.

The `FrameCaptureSession` captures frames via `SCStream` at configurable FPS.

A final paragraph with `inline code` to complete the stagger sequence.
