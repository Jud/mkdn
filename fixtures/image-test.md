# Image Rendering Test

## Remote Images

A landscape photo loaded from the web:

![Landscape photo](https://picsum.photos/seed/mkdn-landscape/600/400)

Some text between images to test mixed content flow.

## Different Sizes

Small image (200x150):

![Small photo](https://picsum.photos/seed/mkdn-small/200/150)

Wide panoramic image (800x200):

![Panoramic photo](https://picsum.photos/seed/mkdn-pano/800/200)

## Square Image

## Image with Long Alt Text

![This is a much longer alt text description that tests how the caption wraps when it exceeds the width of the image container](https://picsum.photos/seed/mkdn-alttext/400/250)

## Grayscale and Effects

Grayscale:

Blurred:

## Broken Image

This should show an error state:

![This image does not exist](https://picsum.photos/seed/mkdn-broken/notavalidpath)

## Images Between Content

Here is a paragraph before the image. It contains some text to verify that the layout correctly spaces content around images.

![Mid-content photo](https://picsum.photos/seed/mkdn-mid/500/300)

And here is a paragraph after the image. The spacing above and below should look consistent with other block elements.
